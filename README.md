# Neural Network from Scratch: Diabetes Prediction ðŸ§ ðŸ’‰

This project implements a 2-layer feedforward neural network from scratch using only NumPy. It is trained to predict diabetes outcomes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.  
The goal of this project is to deeply understand the inner workings of neural networks â€” including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent â€” without relying on any machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Features
- Fully manual implementation using NumPy
- Two-layer neural network (1 hidden layer)
- Sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss
- Manual backpropagation and gradient descent updates
- Accuracy computation for training and test sets

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**
- **pandas** (for CSV handling)
- **Matplotlib** (optional, for plotting if added)
- **scikit-learn** (only for `train_test_split`)

---

## Dataset
- [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- 8 input features, binary classification (`Outcome` column)
